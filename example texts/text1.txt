It is very important for practical reasons to include contact information for how to reach you, perhaps in the README file, but this has nothing to do with the legal issues of applying the license.There is no legal requirement to register your copyright with anyone; simply writing the program makes it copyrighted. However, for the US, it is a good idea to register the copyright with the US Registry of Copyrights, because that puts you in a stronger position against anyone who violates the license in the US. Most other countries have no system of copyright registration. We would like to list all free software programs in the Free Software Directory, including all programs licensed under the GPL (any version). So please submit an entry for your program, when it has reached the point of being useful. Please see the Directory web page for information and an online submission form. It is also possible to make your program a GNU package, a part of the GNU Project. If you might be interested in joining up with the GNU Project in this way, please see our GNU software evaluation page for more information and a short questionnaire. We will respond and discuss the matter with you. You are welcome to use any of our licenses even if your program is not a GNU package; indeed, we hope you will. They're available to everyone. If you'd like to advertise your use of a particular license, feel free to use one of our logos.
